Items we need to research:
	unity mod assets (under environment sprites colored category: building, trees, fences, etc.)
	Mod assets, e.g. 2D props 
	Start thinking of music to put in the background (3-4 min song)
		Know how to play with the audio 
	Ask PMs if they can star in our game (enemy skins)
	We can change the route/obstacles of the game
	Different types of animations (assets > character > sprites)
		Look for different files (.png) 

Tasks for next project meeting:
Everyone can look for different assets, compare them, we can see which ones we like best
	watch at least one video to see how it works
Everyone pick 2 songs
Find mod assets
Find a background
